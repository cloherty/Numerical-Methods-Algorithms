## falsePosition

1. This algorithim uses the false position method to determine the roots of any given function within a desired error, and with a certain number of iterations as specified by the user

#### Inputs
- func-function being integrated

- xl-lower guess of root

- xu-upper guess of root

- es-desired relative error

- maxiter-maximum number of iterations performed

#### Outputs
- root-estimated location of root

- fx-function value at root

- ea-approximate relative error

- iter-number of iterations performed
