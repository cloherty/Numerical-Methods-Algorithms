# Numerical-Methods-Algorithms

- In real world problem solving analytical solutions do not exist. Therefore, certain techniques and methods must be derived to deliver accurate analysis from non-symmetrical, real situations. These techniques are often used to approximate the solution to within a finite amount of error, such that these problems can be solved. Some of these techniques include

1. Simpson's Rule
2. LU Decomposition
3. False Position
4. Bisection

- Each of the algorithms found in this repository uses different numerical methods, or combinations thereof, to meet a certain goal. Whether it be defining the root of a function, calculating the magnitude of a data set, or decomposing a system of equations, numerical methods offer a mathematical approach to solving real world applications.
